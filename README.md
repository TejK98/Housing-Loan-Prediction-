The goal of this project is to predict and categorize customers who will be able to repay the money to the bank.

Dataset: This dataset has 29 columns with 1,776 rows, with 28 independent and 1 dependent variable. The dependent variable is approve (1 = “yes” and 0 = “No”).
         The period of time for this dataset is 2 years. 

Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest

Programming Language: R

Software: RStudio

Business Value: 
Based on our final model, the three ways Bank will able to use the model are:

  • The bank does not have to go through the supporting documents of all the customers. It will only have to go through the supporting documents of the customers who are     approved by the algorithm. This saves the manpower used by the bank by decreasing the burden of going throughthe supporting documentation of all the customers.
    
  • Customer satisfaction may increase as the bank response time decreases.
  
  • The chances of the bank losing the money, through scams, decreases.
